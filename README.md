# Python Fun

## About

This is a (very) quick course on python. The goal is to learn some basics in about a couple hours. This is NOT 
the best way to learn python if you are looking to write professional production python. This is a more simple approach meant for those creating basic instructional scripting for tools that accept python as instructions.

In this course will only be running single files. As applications get complicated there will be more files involved. Remember this is a skill, and you're not supposed to get this overnight. people make careers from years of experiences with this knowledge. Take your time.

Some terms that are important:

- local: This is your computer

## Use

### Online

We can run any of the code in this course online. You don't have to install anything. 

Create an account at [https://www.mycompiler.io/](https://www.mycompiler.io/) to run code for free!

Just visit provided links and hit run to execute the code, or "fork" (this means copy to your account )and update the code with your changes.

[Online - hello.py](https://www.mycompiler.io/view/DAzSLjGr0mH)


Success will have additional print out `[Execution complete with exit code 0]`.

If there is an error with the code, a description of the error and a differing code will be printed out.

### In Command Line

##### Local installs

You can run any of ths code on your machine as well.

- python3 installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- text editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

On your machine we will be using the command line to run our python.

This is Terminal in mac and some other thing in Win(I don't have a windows machine... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ).

(what is this? add hacker joke here)

Verify python is installed in command line run: 

`python3 -V`

Should return something like:

`Python 3.9.13`

To Run a python file we can run the hello.py file in this repo

`python3 hello.py`
